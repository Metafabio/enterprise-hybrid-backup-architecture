# Enterprise Hybrid Backup Architecture

## üåç Overview
This project simulates a hybrid cloud backup solution for large enterprise environments with distributed data centers, legacy systems, and mixed operating systems (AIX, Windows, Linux).

The architecture is inspired by real-world experience in managing and improving backup strategies across complex infrastructures.

## üß± Objectives
- Ensure data protection across multiple regions and environments
- Automate agent deployment and monitoring
- Use hybrid cloud to balance cost and retention needs
- Enable long-term archive in Azure/S3 with on-prem fast recovery

## üß© Key Components

| Function               | Technology                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Backup Engine          | Commvault v11/v12               |
| Cloud Storage          | Azure Blob (Cool) + S3 Glacier |
| Automation             | Ansible for agent deployment    |
| Monitoring             | Grafana via Commvault APIs      |
| OS Coverage            | AIX, Windows, Linux             |

## üß† Highlights
- Commvault used for its robust support of legacy OS and hybrid cloud
- Azure Blob for short-term DR; S3 Glacier for long-term archival
- Monitoring via Prometheus + Grafana using Commvault job APIs
- Secure access via site-to-site VPN and RBAC policies
